# PlayCat

This is a project to learn C++ and gain skills in openCV. In general we want a laser tower that plays with a cat.

It is divided into two main parts:

A [server](server/README.md) can find your cat using a camera, does all the hard work and controls the client.

A [client](client/README.md) that has the sole job of controlling servos with a laser pointer attached to them.
